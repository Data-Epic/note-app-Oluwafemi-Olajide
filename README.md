# Learning Journey

## Task 1: Creating the Base Class Note

This task was relatively easy for me.
A key learning point was realizing that I should not include the created_at attribute in the __init__ method of the Note parent class.
Additionally, with the help of online examples, I successfully printed the created_at timestamp correctly after lots of errors messages.

## Task 2: Implementing Inheritance (TextNote Class)

This section helped me better understand how to use the super() function.
I successfully called methods from the parent class inside the child class, reinforcing my understanding of OOP concepts.

## Task 2.1: Adding a Reminder Feature (TimeReminder Class)

A key learning experience was understanding how to include and call attributes within a child class that had additional attributes (content and reminder_time).
I also applied super() to inherit and use the content attribute from the parent class.

## Task 3: Implementing the NotesManager Class

This task was quite challenging.
I was unsure whether to create separate subclasses for different actions within the NotesManager class.
My initial implementation was generating error responses i just removed it and sticked with the 1-2 task i could do
I would appreciate corrections and solutions to improve this part of the project. THANK YOU
