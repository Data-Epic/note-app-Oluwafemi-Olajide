# Smart Note Manager

##  Project Description
Smart Note Manager is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to create, manage, and search notes efficiently. It supports two types of notes:
- **Text Notes**: Regular notes with text content.
- **Reminder Notes**: Notes with a specified reminder time.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.

---
##  Features
- Create text and reminder notes
- View all saved notes
- Delete notes by ID
- Search notes by keyword
- User-friendly CLI interface

---
##  OOP Concepts Used
1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Attributes like `self.notes` are encapsulated within the `NotesManager` class.
   - Users interact with the class via methods instead of accessing attributes directly.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - Methods like `add_note()` hide complex object creation logic from the user.
   
3. **Inheritance**:
   - `TextNote` and `ReminderNote` inherit from the `Note` base class.
   
4. **Polymorphism**:
   - The `display()` method is overridden in `TextNote` and `ReminderNote` for customized output.
